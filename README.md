# r-basics
In this tutorial we will cover functions, variables, how to import data, and how to run a simple regression
## Functions

  R has all the most common arithmetic functions and follows the standard order of operations (PEMDAS). ``` + ```, ``` - ```, ``` * ```, and ``` / ``` are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectively. There are also some common functions that are very helpful.
```R
  log(1)              # logarithm to base e
## [1] 0
log10(1)            # logarithm to base 10
## [1] 0
exp(1)              # e to the power of
## [1] 2.718282
sqrt(4)             # square root
## [1] 2
2^3                   # 2 to the power of 8
## [1] 8
pi                    # not a function but useful
## [1] 3.141593
```

## Variables/Objects

  Now that we know how to write functions, what if we want to assign these to a variable. 
  It is important to recognize that R is an object oriented programming
